      <h1>exp.o Visibility Reporting Redesign</h1>

      <div id="project-info">

        <p>Role: User Experience Lead at Expeditors</p>

        <p>exp.o Visibility is a web application for Expeditors customers to track and report on their logistics data (shipments, orders, customs entries, inventory levels and electronic document images). Due to usability and performance issues, customers would often rely on Expeditors reps and support to provide the reports they needed (using an internal-only, legacy system), instead of using exp.o Visibility to self-serve the information. Rather getting the information they needed right away, it could sometimes take days.<p>

        <p>The goal of this project was to transform the reporting tool in exp.o Visibility so that is usable and functional, enables customers to self-serve the information they need, and creates a positive user experience. We tackled this by employing UX design and research best practices, usability heuristics, proven interaction patterns, and the simplest possible workflows.</p>

        <p>This was our approach, at a high-level:</p>


           <ul>
              <li>Conduct an initial research sprint to validate assumptions about the system's usability. Methods used were analysis of user feedback and support tickets, contextual inquiry, and hueristic review.</li>
              <li>Research and brainstorm improved reporting workflow.</li>
              <li>Create and validate new workflow with a first-click test.</li>
              <li>Create an initial, clickable prototype and conduct usability test to further validate workflow and form controls.</li>
              <li>Refine prototype and conduct a second usability test.</li>
              <li>Conduct a series of mini-studies to validate the workflow and controls around creating, running, and scheduling a report, and viewing a report's results.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>At this point I left my role at Expeditors. The new workflow and some of the new features are currently in beta. The application isn't available to the public, but this is a <a href="https://expeditors-1.wistia.com/medias/5oy2c69fc3">demo video</a> that showcases the functionality. There are also some screenshots in the <a href="http://help.expeditors.com/globalhelp/expovisibilityreporting/exp.o_Visibility_Help_Center.htm">help contents</a>. I had no role in creating the video or the help contents.</p>

          <h2>Clickable/Interactive Prototypes</h2>
          <p>Here are some examples of prototypes I created to illustrate functionality for our devs, and for usability testing. The data is all dummy/hard-coded. You can go ahead and give the tasks a try. :) <strong>Each scenario will open in a new window.</strong></p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/ministudy-02-scenario-01.html" target="_blank">Scenario 1</a><br />
          Task: Participant was asked to run a report showing ocean shipments going from Shanghai to New York (NYC).</p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/ministudy-02-scenario-02.html" target="_blank">Scenario 2</a><br />
          Task: Participant was asked to run a report showing ocean shipments going from Shanghai and Shenzhen to New York (NYC). </p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/ministudy-02-scenario-02-results.html" target="_blank">Scenario 3</a><br />
          Task: Participant was asked to update report results to show ocean shipments going from Hong Kong to New York (NYC).</p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/ministudy-02-scenario-04.html" target="_blank">Scenario 4</a><br />
          Task: Participant was asked to run a report showing all shipments that have arrived to New York (JFK), Newark, and Laguardia.</p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/ministudy-02-scenario-05.html" target="_blank">Scenario 5</a><br />
          Task: Participant was asked to run a report showing all shipments that are estimated to arrive the following week.</p>

          <p><a href="ux-site/self-service/edit-report.html" target="_blank">Edit Report screen</a><br />
          Most of the controls on this prototype are not functional. This is the screen a user would land on if they selected to edit/customize a report.</p>
